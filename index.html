	<h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Owen Graham and this is my personal web page for Web Development II.
		Here are some fun facts about me:
		<ul>
			<li>I am from Maryville, Missouri and I am 20 years old</li>
			<li>I am a licensed amateur radio operator. This gives me the ability to talk
				to anyone around the world. I can also talk to astronauts aboard the ISS or
				I can use satellites the size of a shoebox to reach the other side of the Earth!</li>
			<li>In my free time, you'll find me writing or playing music, operating ham radio,
				or finding good articles of these two things online. I also love to hang out with
				my band friends!</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>My major and career plans</h2>
		<p>
			I am currently a junior/3rd year Computer Science major, with a minor in music. I have
			 considered continuing my education to obtain a Master's degree, but that's for a later
			 topic! For now, here are some highlights that I have had here at Northwest:
			 <ol>
				 <li>I am active in the band fraternity here on campus, and many of my friends are.</li>
				 <li>I attend the MakerSpace here on campus weekly. Did you know that a 3D printer is actually
					 useful for a lot of things???</li>
				<li>I love taking long walks here on campus. There is so much nature to take in and places
					that I haven't explored!</li>
				</ol>
			Well that's just a bit of what I do here on campus. I do lots of other things but these stand
			out to me the most and these make me who I am.

		<p>
			You can find me on the web and YouTube, but my YouTube accounts are in their infancy. I post music
			 covers I make online as well as the many things I learn about in amateur radio. My website is here
			 at <a href="https://ke0sbx.blogspot.com">ke0sbx.blogspot.com.</a> I update it often, so there will
			 be new stories and blogs awaiting for your reading pleasure!
