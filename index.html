		<h2>What I do</h2>
		<p>
			You can find me on the web and YouTube, but my YouTube accounts are in their infancy. I post music
			 covers I make online as well as the many things I learn about in amateur radio. My website is here
			 at <a href="https://ke0sbx.blogspot.com">ke0sbx.blogspot.com.</a> I update it often, so there will
			 be new stories and blogs awaiting for your reading pleasure! If you'd like to see where I go to school
			 at, you can read about it and explore it at <a href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu">nwmissouri.edu.</a>
			 The website has been updated and looks really nice! It's amazing what HTML5 and CSS can do.

    <h2>Here is some info about me:</h2>
    <p>
			<ul>
				<li>I am from Maryville, Missouri and I am 20 years old</li>
				<li>I am a licensed amateur radio operator. This gives me the ability to talk
					to anyone around the world. I can also talk to astronauts aboard the ISS or
					I can use satellites the size of a shoebox to reach the other side of the Earth!</li>
				<li>In my free time, you'll find me writing or playing music, operating ham radio,
					or finding good articles of these two things online. I also love to hang out with
					my band friends!</li>
			</ul>

    <h2>My major and career plans:</h2>
    <p>
			I am currently a junior/3rd year Computer Science major with a minor in music. I have
			 considered continuing my education to obtain a Master's degree, but that's for a later
			 topic! For now, here are some highlights that I have had here at Northwest:
			 <ol>
				 <li>I am active in the band fraternity here on campus, and many of my band friends are.</li>
				 <li>I attend the MakerSpace here on campus weekly. Did you know that a 3D printer is actually
					 useful for a lot of things???</li>
				<li>I love taking long walks here on campus. There is so much nature to take in and places
					that I haven't explored!</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Well that's just a bit of what I do here on campus. I do lots of other things but these stand
			out to me the most and these make me who I am.
